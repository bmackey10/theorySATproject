Theory of Computing: Project 1 - SAT

Thomas Mercurio, Brooke Mackey, Jack Munhall


2SAT:
- The 2SAT.py program performed the 2SAT algorithm as described in the project document.
- The file input to the program was the file CNF/2SAT.cnf and the output of this program is CSV/2SAT.csv.
- The brute.py program was also run with the file CNF/2SAT.cnf to compare outputs.
  - Using the brute.py programs outputs to verify the 2SAT.py outputs, we found that our 2SAT.py algorithm correctly determined the satisfiability or unsatisfiability and the assigned values 100% of the time.
  - 50 of the WFFs were unsatisfiabile, while 50 of the WFFs were satisfiable.
